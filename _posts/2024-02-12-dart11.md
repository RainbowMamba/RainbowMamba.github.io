# Class

Dart is an object-oriented language.
If you don't know what OOP is, go back to the highschool.
This is how you make class in Dart.
```dart
class SoccerTeam {
  String clubName;
  List<String> players;

  SoccerTeam(String clubName, List<String> players)
      : this.clubName = clubName,
        this.players = players;
  
  void introduce() {
    print("This is the best soccer team, $clubName");
  }
}
```
You can see member variables, constructor, and method.  
There are other ways for constructor.
```dart
SoccerTeam(this.clubName, this.players); // Easier one

// Named constructor
SoccerTeam.fromList(List v)
  : this.clubName = v[0],
    this.players = v[1]; 
```

Create instance
```dart
SoccerTeam manCity = SoccerTeam(
  "ManchesterCity",
  ["Ederson", "Walker", "Stones", "De Bruyne"],
);
```

Immutable programming.
```dart
class SoccerTeam {
  final String clubName;
  final List<String> players;

  const SoccerTeam(this.clubName, this.players);
}
```
