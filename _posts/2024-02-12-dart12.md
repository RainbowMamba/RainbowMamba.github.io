# Getter and Setter

Don't take it seriously.
Getter gets the value and setter sets the value.
Here's how to use them.
```dart
class SoccerTeam {
  String clubName;
  List<String> players;

  SoccerTeam(String clubName, List<String> players)
      : this.clubName = clubName,
        this.players = players;

  // Getter
  String get goalKeeper{
    return players[0];
  }

  //Setter
  set goalKeeper(String name){
    this.players[0] = name;
  }
}

void main() {
  SoccerTeam manCity = SoccerTeam(
    "ManchesterCity",
    ["Ederson", "Walker", "Stones", "De Bruyne"],
  );
  
  print(manCity.goalKeeper); // Ederson
  manCity.goalKeeper = "Carson"; // Ederson -> Carson
}
```
