# Thoughts on learning to code.
## The balance between tool and theory is crucial.
Recently I started to learn how to code. 
Actually, I knew how to code to some degree because I took some classes on programming in university.
However, serving in the military, I forgot lots of them.
As the day of discharge comes, I thought about what to do after discharge.
I wanted to build some mobile apps and do some business with them.  

I started to learn coding with flutter. 
First, I learned about Dart in Youtube and then learn flutter with online courses.
As I was learning flutter, I thought that coding is more about thinking than typing.
In order to deal with difficult problems, you have to think algorithmically.  

That was why I decided to start to take CS courses.
I'm now taking CS50 by David J.Malan and planning to take Algorithm Part 1 afterward.  

In this case, flutter is the tool and CS courses are theories.
If I only do flutter without the practices of thinking and learning the root part of programming, there must be some barriers leveling up my skills.
Whereas if I only focus on the root, base part, it would take years to make a decent mobile app.
So balancing between the two is the crucial part of learning to code.  

I wrote this to keep in mind these facts and I'm planning to write on the couses I take if possible.
