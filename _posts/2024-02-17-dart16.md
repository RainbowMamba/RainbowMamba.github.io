# Interface

You can use interface as a certain form you have to follow making class.
Make interface just like class but without initializing variables or methods.
```dart
class PlayerInterface {
  String name;
  PlayerInterface(this.name);
  void introduce() {}
}
```
Class using `PlayerInterface` must have variable `String name`, method `void introduce()`.
Use interface with class using `implements`.
```dart
class ManUPlayer implements PlayerInterface {
  String name;
  ManUPlayer(this.name);
  void introduce() {
    print('this is $name');
  }
}
```
You can put abstract in front of the interface to prevent making instance out of the class.
```dart
abstract class PlayerInterface {
  String name;
  PlayerInterface(this.name);
  void introduce(); // You can omit the function's body using abstract keyword.
}
```
