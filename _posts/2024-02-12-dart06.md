# If  

If you have lived normal life, you can understand `if` easily.
```dart
int a = 10;

if (a == 10) {
  print("Ten!!");
}
```
`if (con) {action};` basically if statement looks like this and if the `con` is true, `action` occurs.
You can use else for the case where `con` is false.
```dart
if (a == 10) {
  print("Ten!!");
} else {
  print("Not Ten!!");
}
```
Also you can add condition after else.
```dart
if (a == 10) {
  print("Ten!!");
} else if (a == 9){
  print("Nine!!");
}
```

# Switch  

`Switch` is simplified version of `If`.
```dart
int a = 10;

switch(a){
  case 8:
    print("eight");
  case 9:
    print("nine");
  case 10:
    print("ten");
  default:
    print("number");
}
```
So there is the value in `switch(value)` and the code starts at the `case value:`.
There's no fallthrough execution for non-empty cases in Dart.
You don't have to use `break;` in non-empty cases.
Use it only in empty cases.
`default` is literally default action when the value has no match.
