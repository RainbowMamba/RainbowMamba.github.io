# Null Safety  

Dart provides null safety. Null safety prevents the issues caused by null(which means nothing as value).
When you try to use a variable and it is unexpectedly null, it can cause crash on program.
In Dart, every variable is non-nullable, which means it cannot be null.
If you want to make it nullable, use `?` after the type keyword.  
```dart
// Error
var a;
print(a);
```
```dart
// No Error
var? a;
print(a); // It prints 'null'.
```
