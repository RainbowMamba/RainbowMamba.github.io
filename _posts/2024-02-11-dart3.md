# Null Safety  
## ?
Dart provides null safety. Null safety prevents the issues caused by null(which means nothing as value).
When you try to use a variable and it is unexpectedly null, it can cause crash on program.
In Dart, every variable is non-nullable, which means it cannot be null.
If you want to make it nullable, use `?` after the type keyword.  
```dart
// Error
int a;
print(a);
```
```dart
// No Error
int? a;
print(a); // It prints 'null'.
```
## !
If you put `!` at the end of the nullable variable, it means that the variable is not null.
```dart
var b = 1;
int? a;
if (b > 3) {
  a = b;
};
print(a!);
```
## late
`late` means that you're gonna initialize the variable later.
So don't treat the variables with `late` like it's nullable ones.
```dart
late int a;
```
