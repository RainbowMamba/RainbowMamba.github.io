# Inheritance

Using inheritance with `extends`, you can inherit properties of the parent to the child.
```dart
class SoccerTeam {
  String clubName;
  int playersCount;

  SoccerTeam({required this.clubName, required this.playersCount});

  void introduce() {
    print("This is the best soccer team, $clubName");
  }
}

class PremiereLeagueTeam extends SoccerTeam {
  PremiereLeagueTeam(
    String clubName,
    int playersCount,
  ) : super(
          clubName: clubName,
          playersCount: playersCount,
        );

// Add child's method
  void sayPremiereLeague(){
    print("This is Premiere League team.");
  }
}

void main() {
  PremiereLeagueTeam manU = PremiereLeagueTeam("Manchester United", 27);
  
  manU.introduce(); // Using parent's method
  manU.sayPremiereLeague(); // Using child's method

  print(manU is PremiereLeagueTeam); // true
  print(manU is SoccerTeam); // true
}
```
