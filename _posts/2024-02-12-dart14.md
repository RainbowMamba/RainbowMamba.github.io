# Override

You can literally override method 
```dart
class SoccerTeam {
  final String clubName;
  int playersCount;

  SoccerTeam({required this.clubName, required this.playersCount});

  void introduce() {
    print("This is the best soccer team, $clubName");
  }
}

class PremiereLeagueTeam extends SoccerTeam {
  PremiereLeagueTeam(
    String clubNameP,
    int playersCountP,
  ) : super(
          clubName: clubNameP,
          playersCount: playersCountP,
        );

  @override
  void introduce(){
    print("This is Premiere League team $super.clubName.");
  }
}
```
