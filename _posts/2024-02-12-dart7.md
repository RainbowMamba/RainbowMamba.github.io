# For

`for` loop looks like this
```dart
for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
  print(a);
}
```
```plaintext
0
1
2
```

It works well with list. Look.
```dart
List<int> num = [2, 3, 4];

for(int i in num){
  print(i);
}
```
```plaintext
2
3
4
```

# While  

In while loop which looks like this `while(con){action}`,
if the `con` is `true`, action repeatedly occurs until the `con` is false.  
```dart
int a = 3;

while(a < 6){
  a++;
  print(a);
}
```
```plaintext
4
5
6
```
If you use `do{action}while(con);` statement, at first, action occurs regardless of the con.
Then, it works just as `while`.
```dart
int a = 2;

do {
  a++;
  print(a);
} while(a < 6 && a > 2);
```
```plaintext
3
4
5
6
```
If I didn't use `do`, it must have printed nothing because `a` doesn't satisfy the condition.
