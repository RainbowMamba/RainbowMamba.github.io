# How to print "Hello World!" with Dart  

I recommend you to use [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/?) when you start to learn Dart.  
It's pretty handy Web IDE for Dart.  

It's really easy to print "Hello World!" with Dart.
```dart
void main() {
print("Hello World!");
}
```
```plaintext
"Hello World!"
```
