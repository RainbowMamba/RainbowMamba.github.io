# Static

If you use `static` keyword in front of the member of the class, the member is bound to the class not instance.
```dart
class SoccerPlayer {
  static String? clubName;
  int age;

  SoccerPlayer(this.age);

  void introduce() {
    print("I'm in the best soccer team, $clubName");
  }
}

void main() {
  SoccerPlayer.clubName = "ManCity"; // Working bound to class
  SoccerPlayer ederson = SoccerPlayer(30);
  
  ederson.introduce();
}

```
