# How to create and initialize variable  

Creating and initializing variable.  
```dart
var a;
a = 10;
```

You can do both at the same time.  
```dart
var a = 10;
```

# Types of variable  

## Numbers  

Use `int` for integer value.  
```dart
int a = 10;
```

Use `double` for double value (real number).  
```dart
double b = 10.1;
```

You can use `num` for both.
```dart
num n1 = 10.1;
num n2 = 10.1;
```

## Strings  

Use `String` for string value.  
```dart
String a = "Billionaire";
```
You can use either single or double quotes.  

You can put values in a string like the following.
```dart
int a = 10;
String s = "apples";
print("I ate $a green $s.");
```
```plaintext
I ate 10 green apples.
```

Triple quotes can make multi-line string
var s1 = '''
        You can create
multi-line strings like this one.
''';

## Booleans
Use `bool` for boolean values(only `true` and `false`).  
```dart
bool t = true;
bool f = false;
```
