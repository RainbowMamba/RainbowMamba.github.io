# How to create and initialize variable  

Creating and initializing variable  
```dart
var a;
a = 10;
```

You can do both at the same time.  
```dart
var a = 10;
```

# Types of variable  

## Numbers  

use `int` for integer value  
```dart
int a = 10;
```

use `double` for double value (real number)  
```dart
double b = 10.1;
```
what if you write initialize a variable like this `double a = 1;`?  
then a is equal to `1.0`  

## Strings  

use `String` for string value  
```dart
String a = "Billionaire";
```
