# How to create and initialize variable  

Creating and initializing variable  
```dart
var a;
a = 10;
```

You can do both at the same time.  
```dart
var a = 10;
```

# Types of variable  

## Numbers  

Use `int` for integer value  
```dart
int a = 10;
```

Use `double` for double value (real number)  
```dart
double b = 10.1;
```

What if you write initialize a variable like this `double a = 1;`?  
Then `a` is equal to `1.0`  

## Strings  

Use `String` for string value  
```dart
String a = "Billionaire";
```
You can use either single or double quotes.  

You can put values in a string like the following.
```dart
int a = 10;
String s = "apples";
print("I ate $a green $s.");
```
